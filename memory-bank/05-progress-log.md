## New Entry

### July 27, 2024 - Project Refactoring and Cleanup
- **Phase:** Transition from POC to Structured Application
- **Changes:**
    - Reorganized the project into a clean directory structure (`src`, `src/Models`, `src/Clients`, `src/Utils`).
    - Centralized all data models to avoid duplication.
    - Refactored the `Utils` class into more specific helper classes.
    - Isolated the original POC clients from the new RLS tests to improve clarity.
    - Added a `.gitignore` file to keep the repository clean.
- **Outcome:** The project is now significantly cleaner, more professional, and easier to maintain and scale. The new structure clearly separates new development from legacy/comparison code.

### July 28, 2024 - Enhanced Security and Readability
- **Phase:** RLS Implementation & Refinement
- **Changes:**
    - **Patched Security Vulnerability:** Corrected a critical RLS policy on storage that previously allowed any authenticated user to list all files in a bucket, preventing a data leak.
    - **Introduced Readable Patient IDs:** Replaced UUIDs with a human-readable, auto-incrementing `patient_code` (e.g., `P001`) for identifying patients.
    - **Updated Storage Paths:** All storage operations now use the `patient_code` for folder paths (e.g., `emg-data/P001/file.c3d`), improving readability and management.
    - **Refined RLS Policies:** All database and storage RLS policies were updated to use the new `patient_code`, simplifying the security logic.
    - **Improved Test Filenames:** The automated tests now generate files with more descriptive names (e.g., `P001_C3D-Test_20231027_123000.c3d`) for easier debugging.
- **Outcome:** The application is now more secure, with properly isolated patient data. The use of readable IDs and filenames significantly improves the developer experience and makes the system easier to debug and maintain. The core RLS testing framework is robust and validates the correct security behavior.

### Session: 2025-06-12 (RLS and Auth Debugging)
- **Issue**: Encountered "new row violates row-level security policy" error during RLS tests.
- **Analysis**:
    - Initial fix attempt by modifying C# code failed because the root cause was in the SQL policy.
    - The RLS policy for `emg_sessions` was missing a `WITH CHECK` clause, causing `INSERT` operations to fail by default.
- **Fix**:
    - Corrected the `emg_sessions` policy in `01_init_schema.sql` to include the required `WITH CHECK` clause.
    - Reverted incorrect C# code changes that were causing a `therapist_id` column not found error.
- **Issue**: Authentication was failing when running tests with default credentials.
- **Analysis**: The program logic prompted for a password but had no fallback, causing it to use an empty string when the user pressed Enter.
- **Fix**: Added logic to `src/main.cs` to use the default password from the configuration if the password field is left blank.
- **Documentation**: Updated the memory bank (`04-api-documentation.md` and `02-components.md`) with the final, correct RLS policies and a summary of the comprehensive RLS test coverage.

### Session: 2025-06-20 (Advanced RLS Policy Debugging)
- **Issue**: File uploads were failing with "new row violates row-level security policy" for the therapist user, even though they were authenticated and the policy seemed correct. The error only occurred in the client comparison test against the `c3d-files` bucket, while the more complex multi-therapist test against the `emg_data` bucket was succeeding.
- **Analysis**:
    1.  Initial investigation revealed a subtle but critical conflict between RLS policies. The policies for the `emg_data` bucket were incorrectly assigned to the `public` role instead of the `authenticated` role. This caused the database to evaluate both sets of policies for the therapist user, leading to a `false` result from the `emg_data` policy check when operating on the `c3d-files` bucket.
    2.  After fixing the policy roles, the issue persisted. Further analysis of the C# code revealed a configuration error. The client factory method was hardcoded to use the bucket name configured for the RLS tests (`emg_data`) for *all* client instances, instead of using the correct bucket (`c3d-files`) for the comparison test.
- **Fix**:
    - **RLS Policies**: Replaced all `public` role policies with correctly scoped `authenticated` role policies, consolidating them for clarity and efficiency.
    - **C# Code**: Refactored the `CreateClient` method in `src/main.cs` to accept a bucket name parameter. Updated the test execution logic to pass the correct bucket name depending on which test suite was being run.
- **Outcome**: All tests now pass successfully. The RLS policies are clean and correctly scoped, and the client creation logic is robust. This session highlighted the importance of both correct RLS policy design and precise client-side configuration.
- **Documentation**:
    - Created a new, professional `README.md` with a clear project structure.
    - Created a new `RLS_POLICY_SUMMARY.md` document and moved it into the Memory Bank (`06-rls-policy-summary.md`).
    - Updated the architecture document (`01-architecture.md`) with an explanation of Supabase's core SQL schemas.
    - Updated this progress log.
    - Moved and revamped the `SECURITY_TESTS.md` report into the Memory Bank (`07-security-validation-report.md`).

## Scope and Outcome
- **Scope:** Initial setup of five core Memory Bank documents.
- **Outcome:** The Memory Bank is now active and provides essential context for future development.
