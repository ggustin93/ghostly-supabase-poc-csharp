# Progress Log

## June 2025

- **Project Refactoring & Cleanup:** Overhauled project structure by relocating test suites and documentation into `src/` and `memory-bank/` respectively. Updated `.gitignore`.
- **Documentation Overhaul:** Rewrote and standardized all `memory-bank` documentation and the `README.md` for clarity, accuracy, and professionalism.
- **Security Fix (RLS):** Resolved a critical RLS policy violation by correcting a misconfigured policy on the `storage.objects` table. This fix ensures authenticated users can upload to their designated buckets without triggering a security policy failure.
- **Bug Fix (Testing):** Fixed a persistent test failure by correcting the storage bucket configuration used during test suite initialization.

## May 2025

- **Project Scaffolding:** Set up the initial C# Supabase POC project.
- **Feature Implementation:** Implemented core features for file upload and RLS policy testing.
- **Initial Security Tests:** Developed initial security tests for RLS policies.
